# Global Game Jam 2020
## Theme: **?**

## Install
Executables are located into the directory `game/`

## Controls


## Build
On Windows you need git, Visual Studio and CMake installed. Run `build_win32.bat`.
On Mac you need git, a compiler, CMake and possibly other dependencies (OpenGL, SDL2, etc). Install what ever cmake barfs about. Run `build_osx.sh`
On Linux is should work just as on Mac, but hasn't been tested in a long time.
